# Parental-provision-and-body-temperature-increase-brain-size-in-vertebrates
Code and data for Parental investment and body temperature explain encephalization in vertebrates. Using 2600 species across all major vertebrate classes, we test how newborn size and body temperature shape brain-size evolution. Results show synergistic effects enabling large brains in warm, highly investing lineages.
